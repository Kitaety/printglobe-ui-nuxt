The <strong>safe area</strong> is the area in which all critical art must appear. Logos or phone numbers outside of the safe area may be cut off when the product is trimmed to size. The <strong>product line</strong> simply shows the finished size of your product.\n\nA <strong>bleed</strong> refers to artwork printed all the way up to the trimmed edge of a product.

CMYK printing is the best method to achieve realistic looking photographs on a printed piece.\n\nSince the colors are a mix of dots over other dots, there is a good chance color will vary from printer to printer and job to job.\n\nCMYK printing cannot reproduce every PMS color.`

                        text: `![](${serverRoot}/images/artfaq-pms.png)\n\nPantone (PMS) colors work exactly like a paint chip at the hardware store. This type of printing consists of printing with 1 or more pre-mixed colors (generally 1, 2 or 3 colors at once). Spot printing uses a color system of solid, premixed colors known as Pantone colors.\n\nWhen using spot printing, colors are more accurate because you have already determined the color by its speciﬁc Pantone number. Since the ink is not being mixed, that color will not change from one print run to the next. For example: a Pantone 186 Red will always be 186 Red, just like Cornflower Blue at the Home Depot in Des Moines is the same as the Cornflower Blue at the Home Depot in Chicago. Industry standard is to print within a single shade of a specified Pantone color.\n\nSome colors, such as metallics and fluorescents, are only available as spot colors–the same color and effect cannot  be achieved using 4-color process.\n\nSpot color is generally more economical if printing is kept to 3 colors or less.`

                answer_text:
                    'Many of our products will easily print in multiple colors, either full four color printing or multiple PMS colors. Some products, such as certain pennants and plastic bags, simply work best with single PMS colors. Your Account Manager can help you choose the best printing method for your product.\n\nAnd if you wish to see only products that can print in Full Color, you can find them in the main menu at the top of the page.\n\nWhen printing more than one color, there are a couple considerations to keep in mind. Some print methods do a better job than others of "registering" or lining up the imprint colors to each other. Promotional products are printed in a variety of ways, such as pad printed, screen printed, or by letterpress. With any of these methods imprint colors can move as much as 1/8" in position and compared with other imprint colors. Some products, such as balloons and plastic bags, may even require a significant gap between imprint colors and therefore give best results as a one-color imprint.\n\nWhere the colors overlap you may notice some color variations in the imprint colors. Some colors are less noticeable. Some may be quite noticeable.\n\nOn some products, there is no way to  precisely print adjacent colors and guarantee perfect color registration. The amount of trapping and overprinting required by any specific product varies. If you have questions or concerns, please contact our Customer Service about your specific art and product ordered.'
